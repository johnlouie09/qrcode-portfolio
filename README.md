## Portfolio for Qrcode
This is for a portfolio activity that will be submitted tomorrow, but the developer is so lazy!

1. Download and install
   [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
   and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/),
   if you haven't already.

2. Start Apache and MySQL through XAMPP if not already running.

3. Clone or download this repository to your XAMPP **htdocs** folder.
   The final path should be `path_to/xampp/htdocs/qrcode-portfolio`.

4. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory **qrcode-portfolio**.

5. Execute the following commands to install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

6. Compile and run the development server with hot reloading:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open your web browser and access <http://localhost:5173/> to view the application.
